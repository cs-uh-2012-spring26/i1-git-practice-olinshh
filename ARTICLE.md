I think **Google DeepMind** is inspring due to their applications of machine learning in solving massive problems in science. Particularly, **AlphaGo** and **AlphaFold** are the two of the most famous projects for this lab. Watching the documentary about **AlphaGo** was both devastating and beautiful as it unlocked new capabilities in machine learning but delivered heart break to the community of Go in South Korea. **AlphaFold** was a nobel prize winning contribution to science that essentially fixed the modeling of protein folding. Projects like this make Google DeepMind one of the most successful and fascinating Computer Science labs in recent history.

I found this article really interesting, especially how it highlights the impact of machine learning beyond traditional software applications. The examples of AlphaGo and AlphaFold clearly show how computer science can influence entire fields like gaming and biology. It also made me reflect on how powerful and far-reaching well-designed algorithms can be.
