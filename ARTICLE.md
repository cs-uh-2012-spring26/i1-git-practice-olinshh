I think **Google DeepMind** is inspring due to their applications of machine learning in solving massive problems in science. Particularly, **AlphaGo** and **AlphaFold** are the two of the most famous projects for this lab. Watching the documentary about **AlphaGo** was both devastating and beautiful as it unlocked new capabilities in machine learning but delivered heart break to the community of Go in South Korea. **AlphaFold** was a nobel prize winning contribution to science that essentially fixed the modeling of protein folding. Projects like this make Google DeepMind one of the most successful and fascinating Computer Science labs in recent history.
